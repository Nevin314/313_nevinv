The trend makes sense. The execution time scales linearly with the file size, which is what you expect. If copying/transferring 20 bytes takes x amount of time, then when you have to do the same for 10 times that amount, you expect the time to multiply by 10. Since there is no other factor which changes as you change the file size, the execution time is proportional. 

The main bottleneck is the buffer size. This is because the buffer size determines the total number of requests/responses from the client to the server. A higher number of requests (smaller buffer size) slows down the overall time because it requires more overhead from context switching. The reading and writing of the raw bytes is actually very fast.
